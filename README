It's a type system for C!
Wait, you say. C already has a type system.
Yes, but this one:

    * Can be interpreted or compiled to C, with transparent interop between the two
    * Is in some ways simpler than C's type system (e.g. no explicit pointers)
    * Is in some ways more expressive than C's type system (e.g. explicit weakrefs, methods)
    * Generates basic C code for you (object cleanup / serialization / deserialization / runtime type info)
    * Resolves C struct/union/typedef dependency ordering
    * Generates C types which are easy to work with directly from C code
    * Comes with a REPL (read-eval-print-loop, a.k.a. "shell")

...or at least, that's the elevator pitch.

It's based on certain patterns of C programming which I got into the habit of,
and then got tired of keeping track of the boilerplate for.

The intended use cases are for data structures and application programming.
For low-level stuff you can always drop back down to pure C, and use "extern"
to refer to it.


=== BUILDING & RUNNING

Currently assumes you have gcc available.
Should be as simple as:

    # Generate ./bin/fusc
    ./compile

    # See usage instructions
    ./bin/fusc --help

    # Basic usage (write generated .h and .c contents to stdout)
    ./bin/fusc --hfile --cfile fus/test.fus


=== RUNNING THE TESTS

Should be as simple as:

    ./test


=== THE TYPE SYSTEM

TODO: write it all up in detail.

For now, here is a simple example:

    package: graphs

    # A binary tree is either a branch, or a leaf containing arbitrary data.
    union bintree:
        branch: struct:
            left: @bintree
            right: @bintree
        leaf: any

This basically compiles to:

    typedef struct graphs_bintree graphs_bintree_t;
    typedef struct graphs_bintree_branch graphs_bintree_branch_t;

    enum graphs_bintree_tag {
        GRAPHS_BINTREE_TAG_BRANCH,
        GRAPHS_BINTREE_TAG_LEAF,
        GRAPHS_BINTREE_TAGS
    };

    struct graphs_bintree {
        int tag; /* enum graphs_bintree_tag */
        union {
            graphs_bintree_branch_t* branch;
            any_t leaf;
        } u;
    };

    struct graphs_bintree_branch {
        graphs_bintree_t* left;
        graphs_bintree_t* right;
    };

    void graphs_bintree_cleanup(graphs_bintree_t *it) {
        switch (it->tag) {
            case GRAPHS_BINTREE_TAG_BRANCH:
                graphs_bintree_branch_cleanup(it->u.branch);
                break;
            case GRAPHS_BINTREE_TAG_LEAF:
                any_cleanup(&it->u.leaf);
                break;
            default: break;
        }
        memset(it, 0, sizeof(*it));
    }

    void graphs_bintree_branch_cleanup(graphs_bintree_branch_t *it) {
        graphs_bintree_cleanup(it->left);
        graphs_bintree_cleanup(it->right);
        memset(it, 0, sizeof(*it));
    }

...so we get typedefs, structs, unions, and functions for cleaning up, all for free.

You may notice a reference there to any_t and any_cleanup. What are those?
Well, apart from the compiled code, newfus outputs some standard stuff which implements
a runtime type information system in C (only for newfus types, of course).
Here is most of it:

    typedef struct any any_t;
    typedef struct type type_t;

    struct any {
        type_t *type;
        void *value;
    };

    struct type {
        const char *name;
        void (*cleanup_voidstar)(void *it);
    };

    enum types {
        TYPE_ANY,
        TYPE_TYPE,
        TYPE_GRAPHS_BINTREE,
        TYPE_GRAPHS_BINTREE_BRANCH,
        TYPES
    };

    type_t types[TYPES] = { /* Indexed by: enum types */
        {
            .name = "any",
            .cleanup_voidstar = &any_cleanup_voidstar,
        }
        ,{
            .name = "type",
            .cleanup_voidstar = NULL,
        }
        ,{
            .name = "graphs_bintree",
            .cleanup_voidstar = &graphs_bintree_cleanup_voidstar,
        }
        ,{
            .name = "graphs_bintree_branch",
            .cleanup_voidstar = &graphs_bintree_branch_cleanup_voidstar,
        }
    };

    void any_cleanup(any_t *it) {
        if (!it->type || !it->type->cleanup_voidstar) return;
        it->type->cleanup_voidstar(it->value);
    }

    /* Trampoline functions for use with type_t's cleanup_voidstar function
    pointers above: */
    void any_cleanup_voidstar(void *it) { any_cleanup((any_t *) it); }
    void graphs_bintree_cleanup_voidstar(void *it) { graphs_bintree_cleanup((graphs_bintree_t *) it); }
    void graphs_bintree_branch_cleanup_voidstar(void *it) { graphs_bintree_branch_cleanup((graphs_bintree_branch_t *) it); }

...so we can write generic data structures, like our "bintree" type above,
and still get code generated for free.

In this case, the bintree owns its data; it's also possible to specify weakrefs
with the "weakref" keyword.
(Refcounting and other fancy business is *not* implemented at this time, possibly
not ever.)


Now what if, instead of a binary tree, we want a tree where each node
has an arbitrary number of children?

    package: graphs

    # A tree has an array of children, and some arbitrary data.
    struct tree:
        children: array: @tree
        data: any

This compiles to:

    typedef struct arrayof_graphs_tree arrayof_graphs_tree_t;
    typedef struct graphs_tree graphs_tree_t;

    struct arrayof_graphs_tree {
        size_t size;
        size_t len;
        graphs_tree_t* *elems;
    };

    struct graphs_tree {
        arrayof_graphs_tree_t children;
        any_t data;
    };

    void arrayof_graphs_tree_cleanup(arrayof_graphs_tree_t *it) {
        for (int i = 0; i < it->len; i++) {
            graphs_tree_cleanup(it->elems[i]);
        }
        free(it->elems);
        memset(it, 0, sizeof(*it));
    }

    void graphs_tree_cleanup(graphs_tree_t *it) {
        arrayof_graphs_tree_cleanup(&it->children);
        any_cleanup(&it->data);
        memset(it, 0, sizeof(*it));
    }

...so, we get array types for free.
Newfus comes with an array.h which provides macros for working with
these array types, for instance we could do the following:

    void traverse_tree(graphs_tree_t *tree, void (*visit)(graphs_tree_t *)) {
        /* Traverse given tree depth-first, calling the given "visit"
        function on each node. */

        visit(tree);
        ARRAY_FOR_PTR(graphs_tree_t, tree->children, child) {
            traverse_tree(child, visit);
        }
    }

...there are various macros such as ARRAY_PUSH, ARRAY_POP, etc.
That said, you're free to write your own array-handling code; newfus
arrays are structs with 3 fields: size, len, and elems.
The elems are the C array of elements.
The size is the length of that C array (the array's "capacity").
The len is the number of elements of the C array which are actually
initialized.
